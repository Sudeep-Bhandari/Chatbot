# Python Chatbot

A conversational chatbot built using Python. This project demonstrates how to create an interactive chatbot capable of responding to user queries.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Responds to user input in a conversational style.
- **Predefined Responses**: Includes a set of predefined questions and answers.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles unrecognized input with default responses.
- **Expandable Design**: Easily add new responses or integrate external APIs for advanced functionality.

## Demo

Run the chatbot locally and interact with it in the terminal.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used to implement the chatbot.
- **Libraries**:
  - `nltk`: For natural language processing.
  - `re`: For text pattern matching.
  - `json` or `pickle`: For storing predefined responses (optional).

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sudeep-Bhandari/Chatbot.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Chatbot
   
3. Install dependencies:

   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install nltk
     
4. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   Chatbot.py
   
5. Interact with the chatbot:
   - The chatbot will prompt you to type a message.
   - Type your queries and get responses!
     
## How It Works
1. User Input: The user types a message into the terminal.
2. Processing: The chatbot processes the input using pattern matching or NLP techniques.
3. Response: Based on the input, a relevant response is retrieved and displayed.
